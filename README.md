Backup/restore utilies that work in a plugin like manner.

## Installation

For now, no public package is available, but it's possible to build it and
host in a mirror (in a Nexus server internal pip repository for instance).

```bash
poetry build
pip3 install dist/hazelsync-1.3.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
